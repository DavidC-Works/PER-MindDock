# MindDock

## Description
MindDock is a productivity dashboard designed to run continuously on repurposed hardware such as old laptops, embedded boards, or small form-factor PCs. It provides a persistent, always-visible view of your schedule, goals, and personal metrics. The system synchronizes with Google Calendar, supports goal tracking through a browser-based interface, and offers optional sensor integrations for environmental or biometric data.

MindDock exists to bring clarity and structure into a physical workspace by providing an at-a-glance view of tasks, events, and progress. It emphasizes simplicity, low resource usage, and hardware recycling.

**End Goal:**  
To become a modular, extensible, and self-hosted personal productivity hub that integrates schedules, goals, health data, and environmental metrics into a single real-time dashboard.

## Usage Overview
MindDock runs as a local or network-accessible dashboard. Once hosted on a repurposed machine, it provides:

- A real-time synced view of Google Calendar events  
- Daily and weekly goal creation, editing, and completion tracking  
- Optional sensor data readings (temperature and future modules)  
- Visual feedback when tasks are completed  
- A persistent, always-on display for desk, wall, or workstation setups  

Users interact with MindDock through any browser on the same network. The host device stays running continuously to maintain up-to-date data and dashboard visibility.
